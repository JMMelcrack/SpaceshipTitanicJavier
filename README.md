# Spaceship Titanic â€“ Kaggle Competition

This repository contains my work for the [Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/overview) competition hosted on Kaggle.  

The competition is inspired by the famous Titanic dataset but with a futuristic twist: a spaceship carrying thousands of passengers experiences an accident, and the goal is to predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension.  

## Purpose of this Repository

The repository was created to:  
- Showcase my approach to solving the competition problem.  
- Document the workflow, from data exploration and preprocessing to feature engineering and model development.  
- Share code and insights that could be useful for others interested in machine learning competitions, tabular data problems, or classification tasks.  

## Motivation

By publishing this project, I aim to:  
- Track and organize my progress.  
- Contribute back to the data science community.  
- Provide a reference for future work in similar competitions.  

## Obtained results

My solution achieves a score of 0.78021.
