    "    * HomePlanet - The planet the passenger departed from, typically their planet of permanent residence.\n",
    "    * CryoSleep - Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation for the duration of the voyage. Passengers in cryosleep are confined to their cabins.\n",
    "    * Cabin - The cabin number where the passenger is staying. Takes the form deck/num/side, where side can be either P for Port or S for Starboard.\n",
    "    * Destination - The planet the passenger will be debarking to.\n",
    "    * Age - The age of the passenger.\n",
    "    * VIP - Whether the passenger has paid for special VIP service during the voyage.\n",
    "    * RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck - Amount the passenger has billed at each of the Spaceship Titanic's many luxury amenities.\n",
    "    * Name - The first and last names of the passenger.\n",
    "    * Transported - Whether the passenger was transported to another dimension. This is the target, the column you are trying to predict.\n",
    "* **test.csv** - Personal records for the remaining one-third (~4300) of the passengers, to be used as test data. Your task is to predict the value of Transported for the passengers in this set.\n",
    "* **sample_submission.csv** - A submission file in the correct format.\n",
    "    * PassengerId - Id for each passenger in the test set.\n",
