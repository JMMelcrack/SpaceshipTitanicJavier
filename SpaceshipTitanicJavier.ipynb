Each Id takes the form gggg_pp where gggg indicates a group the passenger is travelling with and pp is their number within the group. People in a group are often family members, but not always.\n    * HomePlanet - The planet the passenger departed from, typically their planet of permanent residence.\n    * CryoSleep - Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation for the duration of the voyage. Passengers in cryosleep are confined to their cabins.\n    * Cabin - The cabin number where the passenger is staying. Takes the form deck/num/side, where side can be either P for Port or S for Starboard.\n    * Destination - The planet the passenger will be debarking to.\n    * Age - The age of the passenger.\n    * VIP - Whether the passenger has paid for special VIP service during the voyage.\n    * RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck - Amount the passenger has billed at each of the Spaceship Titanic's many luxury amenities.\n    * Name - The first and last names of the passenger.\n    * Transported - Whether the passenger was transported to another dimension. This is the target, the column you are trying to predict.\n* **test.csv** - Personal records for the remaining one-third (~4300) of the passengers, to be used as test data. Your task is to predict the value of Transported for the passengers in this set.\n* **sample_submission.csv** - A submission file in the correct format.\n    * PassengerId - Id for each passenger in the test set.\n    * Transported - The target. For each passenger, predict either True or False.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Libraries imports","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-17T22:51:46.328988Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-17T22:51:46.329307Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-17T22:51:46.334775Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-17T22:51:46.329278Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-17T22:51:46.333736Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":2},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1) Dataset loading and visualization","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First of all, we load the training and test sets.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load a dataset into a Pandas Dataframe\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/spaceship-titanic/train.csv')\ntest_df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/spaceship-titanic/test.csv')\n\nprint(\"Full train dataset shape is {}\".format(train_df.shape))\nprint(\"Full test dataset shape is {}\".format(test_df.shape))","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-17T22:53:41.700621Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-17T22:53:41.701025Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-17T22:53:41.799405Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-17T22:53:41.701001Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-17T22:53:41.798601Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Full train dataset shape is (8693, 14)\nFull test dataset shape is (4277, 13)\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# I split the datasets into features (X) and tag (Y)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
